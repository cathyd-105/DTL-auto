# Introduction 
This project aims to test DevTest Lab more efficiently and reduce the time consumption caused by manual operations. 

# Getting Started
###1.	Installation process
First of all, we must first download the Python installation package and VScode installation package.
The download address is as follows:  
Python：https://www.python.org/downloads/  
VScode：https://code.visualstudio.com/  
Install python and VScode and install the python extension in VScode.
###2.	Software dependencies
Simply install the dependency package with 'pip install selenium'. You also need to download the browser's corresponding webdriver driver.  
Python automation is to use the Webdriver tool in the Selenium third-party library to achieve, and Webdirver's working principle is approximately: execute the Python script, and then the script runs to the Selenium third-party library to take the Webdriver tool to open the browser's interface and operate, and returns the result of the response.
###3.	Latest releases
###4.	API references

# Build and Test
Take advantage of the PO mode to integrate several common methods in BasePage.py file. And write several cases in the same file by following the page, reference: page_createLab.py file.
Run code in the test_createLabPage.py for automation.
